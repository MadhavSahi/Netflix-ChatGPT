## ðŸ“Œ Libraries and Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM**: For handling routing and navigation in the application.
- **Redux Toolkit**: To manage the global state and store.
- **React Icons**: To include various icons throughout the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For modular and responsive styling.
- **TMDP API**: For fetching video content and suggestions.
- **UUID**: For generating unique keys for elements.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

### Firebase Authentication

- Netflix GPT uses Firebase Authentication to manage user profiles and enhance the user experience. Firebase Authentication provides secure, password-based sign-up and sign-in mechanisms. Here's how it works within the project:

- **User Profiles:** Users can create personalized profiles by signing up or signing in. This feature allows users to maintain their movie preferences and receive tailored recommendations.

- **Secure Authentication:** Firebase Authentication ensures the security of user credentials and provides a reliable authentication system for the application.

- **User Data Management:** User data, including email, display name, and other relevant information, is stored securely. This data is used to personalize the user experience.

- **Error Handling:** In case of authentication errors, such as invalid login credentials or user already exists, appropriate error messages are displayed to the user for a smooth sign-up and sign-in process.

### TMDB API Integration:

- The application seamlessly integrates with the TMDB APIs, allowing it to retrieve a wide range of video content directly from TMDB's vast movies library.
- Through the power of the `fetch` method, the app dynamically fetches movie details, including titles, descriptions, poster, and videos data, ensuring that users have access to the latest and most relevant videos.
- This real-time data integration keeps the content fresh and also provides users with a diverse selection of movies across various genres and interests.

### React Router DOM

- Utilizes React Router DOM for handling routing and navigation within the application.

- **Navigation:** Users can easily move between these sections by clicking on links, buttons, or navigation elements. The navigation is user-friendly and intuitive.

- **Protected Routes:** Certain routes are protected, meaning they are accessible only to authenticated users. Unauthorized users are redirected to the sign-in page, enhancing security and user access control.

### Redux State Management

- Employs Redux Toolkit to efficiently manage global state and store data. Ensures data consistency and accessibility across different components.
- Displaying Movie Trailer, Trending, Now Playing, Popular is achieved through Redux.

### Responsive Design

- The application is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on various devices and screen sizes. It adapts to different screen resolutions and orientations.

### Chat GPT Search Functionality

- Offers a robust search feature that allows users to search for movies by passing queries.
- Utilize the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model to generate personalized movie recommendations based on user input.
- Get instant movie suggestions for your next viewing.

### Memoization and Caching

- Implements memoization and caching techniques thorugh Redux to optimize API calls and reduce redundant network requests. This improves application performance and speeds up content retrieval.

### Multi-language Support

- Access multiple languages using the language selector.
